# SuperBowl
This dashboard provides a visual history of the Super Bowl, the National Football League's championship game. There have been 55 different Super Bowls, each with their own story to tell. This dashboard provides users with the opportunity to analyze each individual game and learn more about the game's winner, loser, location, margin of victory, and MVP! The dashboard itself features two main datasets, one including each NFL team and the amount of Super Bowls they have one, and a second dataset featuring the demographics of each game. The data used for this dashboard was collected from https://www.pro-football-reference.com/super-bowl/.
